200~# C - Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

This repository contains examples and explanations related to pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language. These concepts are fundamental in C and play a crucial role in memory management, data manipulation, and string handling.

## Contents

1. [Pointers](#pointers)
2. [Arrays](#arrays)
3. [Strings](#strings)

## Pointers

- Pointers are variables that store memory addresses.
- They allow direct manipulation and access to memory locations.
- Pointers can be used for dynamic memory allocation, passing values by reference, and creating data structures.

Examples:
- [Pointer declaration and assignment](./pointers/pointer_declaration.c)
- [Pointer arithmetic](./pointers/pointer_arithmetic.c)
- [Passing pointers to functions](./pointers/passing_pointers_to_functions.c)

## Arrays

- Arrays are collections of elements of the same data type.
- They provide an efficient way to store and access multiple values.
- Array elements are stored in contiguous memory locations.

Examples:
- [Array declaration and initialization](./arrays/array_declaration.c)
- [Accessing array elements](./arrays/accessing_array_elements.c)
- [Passing arrays to functions](./arrays/passing_arrays_to_functions.c)

## Strings

- Strings are sequences of characters terminated by a null character '\0'.
- In C, strings are represented as arrays of characters.
- String manipulation involves various operations like concatenation, comparison, and copying.

Examples:
- [String declaration and initialization](./strings/string_declaration.c)
- [String length calculation](./strings/string_length.c)
- [String concatenation](./strings/string_concatenation.c)
